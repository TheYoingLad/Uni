                <p><strong>Malaga</strong> is a city located in the southern region of Spain, on the <span lang="es"><em>Costa del Sol</em></span>. The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with evidence of settlements dating back to the Bronze Age. Over the centuries, the region has been ruled by various civilizations, each of which has left its mark on the city.</p>
